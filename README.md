# ThunderBox

ThunderBox is a small project of mine where I plan to create a web song player.

# Status

Currently, it is pretty early on in development and there's a lot more I plan to add. As of now it won't work standalone since im figuring out the back end to this, so for now songs won't actually play.
Some features I want to add are playlists, more songs, and the ability to upload them.

# Planned Features

ThunderBox will be a web music player that will have playlists, searchable songs, and song uploads.
